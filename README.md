# Basketball Archive Android App

This a native Android app displays the data via an AWS hosted REST API I created [here](https://github.com/Randall16/Basketball_Stats_Backend).

This app follows the [Model View View-Model architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide). It also incorporated popular libraries such as [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html).
